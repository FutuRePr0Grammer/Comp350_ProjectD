This project is not fully finished. For some reason, "type tstpr2" or "exec tstpr2" etc. does nothing, but the second you type "type messag" it will print
	the message in message.txt no matter what. So if you type "exec tstpr2" after that, it will print what's in message.txt again.

To test: Compile the code "./CompileOS.sh" -> open the simulator "java -jar simulator.jar" -> type "type <filename>" or "exec <filename>" 
	NOTE: messag is the only filename that works.

	UPDATE: FIXED, EVERYTHING WORKS AS INTENDED NOW
