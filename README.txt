This project is fully finished. However, you must type "end" to end a file you are creating. Also if you enter multiple lines, it will add each to its 
	own file with the same name and you can only type the first line, but they are all there!
To test: Compile the code "./CompileOS.sh" -> open the simulator "java -jar simulator.jar" -> type "create <filename> and type a line. Hit enter, type
	"end" -> the file is created. Type "dir" to see it. Type "type <filename> to print the contents. Type "del <filename> to delete it. 
	It is no longer available to see when you type "dir" and you cannot print the contents.
